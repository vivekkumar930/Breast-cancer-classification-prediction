# Breast-cancer-classification-prediction
Machine Learning
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, 
we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer
.A few machine learning techniques will be explored.



Attribute information:

ID number
Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32: Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smootness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" -1)
