# Breast-cancer-classification-prediction

Machine Learning

In this notebook,
I explore the Breast Cancer dataset and develop a Logistic Regression
model to try classifying suspected cells to Benign or Malignant.

Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, 
we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer
.A few machine learning techniques will be explored.



Attribute information:

ID number

Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

3-32: Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smootness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry

j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" -1)
